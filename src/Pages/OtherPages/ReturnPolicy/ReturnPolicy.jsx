            Alternatively, they can also opt for store credit, but there will be a 20% logistics charge deducted from the total payment made.

            To request a return or exchange, customers need to do so within 3-4 days after receiving the product. We require a video of the product being opened and proof that it was returned in the same condition it was sent.
